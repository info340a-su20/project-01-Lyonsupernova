    <section>
        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

        <p class=question>1. Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness'
            and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?")</p>
        <p>Due to the Covid19 pandemic, classes are now held online. Schools rely heavily on zoom to conduct remote
            learning. <em>Remote learning</em> via zoom is a double-edged sword, it can be confusing to use and provide new
            opportunities such as learning without location restrictions as well.</p>
        <p class=question>2. Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to
            homelessness are unaddressed?").</p>
        <p> While school relies heavily on Zoom to conduct classes and other educational activities, zoom links for
            these classes and activities are not well organized. Students often have to look through many different
            sections to find a link for classes. This can be really confusing and time-consuming. We can build better
            solutions to help organize these links.</p>
        <p class=question>3. Identify previous or existing attempts to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to
            address homelessness?")</p>
        <p>Instructors often use <em>canvas</em> as a way to structure the zoom links. Canvas provides zoom links for various
            activities in its daily events for lectures and quizzes to notify students.</p>
        <p class=question>4. While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or
            more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app
            might be able to help with?</p>
        <p>As a college student who has to study remotely via zoom during the Covid19 pandemic, I often have a hard time
            finding the zoom links for various courses and activities on canvas. Each instructor has different ways of
            organizing these links, which can be really confusing and time consuming for our students. This fragmented
            organization does not only create inefficiencies, but also fails to create the sense of community, which is
            especially important during this pandemic.

            This problem needs to be addressed since it is closely related to all students in the US, even other parts
            of the world. The existing solution of organizing the zoom links is through canvas. But because there is no
            consistent way of organization, students are often confused about where to find the desired links. Canvas
            also fails to create a community for us to communicate freely with others. All discussions via Canvas can
            only happen on the discussion board and under the supervision of the instructor. Upon addressing this
            problem, we can not only reduce the inefficiency but also utilize the fact that remote learning via zoom has
            no restrictions on locations to benefit more students.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p class=question>1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?</p>
        <p>Students, workers who need remote learning, or working via zoom or related apps. </p>
        <p class=question>2. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data from an external source (a csv
            file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.</p>
        <p>The information will be the lectures, quizzes, zoom links. we can also provide users with information about
            zoom links of online classes even not in University of Washington. In this way, the users can learn remotely
            despite locations, education, boundaries!</p>
        <p class=question>3. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactions are you expecting to provide?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The users can create events via entering the classes with zoom links.</li>
            <li>The system will help you to find classmates who also take this class.</li>
            <li>The students would be able post messages on the class pages to ask for help from classmates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class=question>4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem
            you described?</p>
        <p>With the organized information of classes and zoom links, the users would be more efficient in dealing with
            the current tough situation of pandemic. </p>
